Hi Marek,
 
if you could, please forward links below to the group, as some people asked me after the talk about materials.
 
The presentation had some slides from the following sources:
1. General Sequence Learning using Recurrent Neural Networks http://www.slideshare.net/indicods/general-sequence-learning-with-recurrent-neural-networks-for-next-ml
    When do we need sequence learning?
2. The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/
   Great examples from vision, language models, etc.
3. Understanding LSTM Networks -- colah's blog http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/
   Excellent visualizations of GRU & LSTM cells
4. Smart Reply: Automated Response Suggestion for Email http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/Paper_1069.pdf
   This is our KDD 2016 paper.

I could also recommend a very good overview of RNNs in the Ian Goodfellow's book:

If people in the group have any questions about RNNs or Google Brain in ZRH, they can contact me via kkurach@google.com
